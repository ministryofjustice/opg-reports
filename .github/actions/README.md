# GitHub composite actions

We have a series of local composite actions to help reduce the amount of repeated code between very similar workflows.

Currently we have the following:

- [Docker build, scan & push](./docker_build_scan_push/README.md)
- [Get OPG Metadata](./get_opg_metadata/README.md)
- [Go build](./go_build/README.md)
- [Go tests](./go_tests/README.md)
- [Report](./report/README.md)
- [S3 Upload](./s3_upload/README.md)
- [Terraform](./terraform/README.md)

Please review each readme for more details on functionality and purpose.
